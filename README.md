# NSMB2_manual_Tracker

All my manual clients work the same way all you have to do is open the page.html file first in a notepad and change the data on the top of it:

<script> 
  let server = undefined; 
  let port = undefined; 
  let password = undefined; 
  let username = undefined 
</script>
switch out the undefined with your data for example on a localhost with no password:

<script> 
  let server = "localhost"; 
  let port = 38281; 
  let password = undefined; 
  let username = "NewSuperPat2" 
</script>

After doing that save the file and you can open it in a browser and it will work right away
